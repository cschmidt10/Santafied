        <br>
        Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
        But the very next day you gave it away
        This year, to save me from tears
        I'll give it to someone special
        Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
        But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
        This year, to save me from tears

        <br>
        Once bitten and twice shy
        I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
        Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
        Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]
        <br>
        (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
        With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
        Now I know what a fool I've been
        But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

        Oh, oh, baby
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 3]
        <br>
        A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
        I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
        My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
        Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 4]
        <br>
        A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
        A man under cover but you tore me apart
        Ooh-hoo
        Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

		title: `Jingle Bells Rock`,
		description: `Jingle Bells is one of the best-known and commonly sung American songs in the world. 
        It was written by James Lord Pierpont (1822–1893) and published under the title "One Horse Open Sleigh" in the autumn of 1857.
        It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday school choir; however, historians dispute this,
        stating that it was much too "racy" (and secular) to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.`,

        It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
        When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
        I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
        Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer
        But then I was illin' because the man had a beard
        And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
        So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
        But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn
        I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause
        Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"
        A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
        Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
        But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
        So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
        But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
        Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me

        And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
        Decorate the house with lights at night
        Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
        In the fireplace is the yule log
        Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
        The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's

		title: `Happy Xmas (War is Over)`,
		description: `"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" was released in 1971 as a single by John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with the Harlem Community Choir. 
        The lyrics are set to the traditional English ballad "Skewball". The song reached number four in the UK, where its release was delayed until November 1972, 
        and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart, most notably after Lennon's death in December 1980, when it peaked at number two. 
        In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted tenth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.

        Also a protest song against the Vietnam War, "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" has since become a Christmas standard, frequently covered by other artists,
        appearing on compilation albums of seasonal music, and named in polls as a holiday favourite.`,

		lyrics: `I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)<br>
        I gotta go away (Baby it's cold outside)<br>
        This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd
        dropped in)<br>
        So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just
        like
        ice)<br>
        My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's
        your
        hurry?)<br>
        My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to
        the
        fireplace roar)<br>
        So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please
        don't
        hurry)<br>
        Well maybe just a half a drink more (I'll put
        some
        records on while I pour)<br>
        The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out
        there)<br>
        Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out
        there)<br>
        I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight
        now)<br>
        To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your
        hair
        looks swell) (Why thank you)<br>
        I ought to say no, no, no sir (Mind if move in
        closer?)<br>
        At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the
        sense of hurtin' my pride?)<br>
        I really can't stay (Baby don't hold out)<br>
        Baby it's cold outside<br>
        <br>
        Ah, you're very pushy you know?<br>
        I like to think of it as opportunistic<br>
        <br>
        I simply must go (Baby it's cold outside)<br>
        The answer is no (But baby it's cold
        outside)<br>
        The welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped
        in)<br>
        So nice and warm (Look out the window at that
        storm)<br>
        My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips
        look
        delicious!)<br>
        My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon
        a
        tropical shore)<br>
        My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips
        are
        delicious!)<br>
        Well maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a
        blizzard before) (And I don't even smoke)<br>
        <br>
        I've got to get home (Baby you'll freeze out
        there)<br>
        Say lend me a coat? (It's up to your knees out
        there!)<br>
        You've really been grand, (I feel when I touch
        your
        hand)<br>
        But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to
        me?)<br>
        There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my
        life
        long sorrow!)<br>
        At least there will be plenty implied (If you
        caught
        pneumonia and died!)<br>
        I really can't stay (Get over that old out)<br>
        Baby it's cold<br>
        Baby it's cold outside<br>
        Okay fine, just another drink then<br>
        That took a lot of convincing!<br>`,

Snow is falling as the carols sing

Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight

Make sure that you know

Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then one day everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

        Christmas comes this time each year<br>

        Well a way up north where the air gets cold<br>
        There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told<br>
        And a real famous cat all dressed up in red<br>
        And he spends the whole year working out on his sled<br>

        It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)<br>
        It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)<br>

        Just a little bob sleigh we call it old Saint Nick<br>
        But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick<br>
        She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel<br>
        And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel<br>

        It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)<br>
        It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)<br>
        Run run reindeer<br>
        Run run reindeer (oh-oh-oh-oh)<br>
        Run run reindeer<br>
        Run run reindeer<br>
        He don't miss no one<br>

        And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed<br>
        With a half a dozen deer with the a-Rudy to lead<br>
        He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies<br>
        And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise<br>

        It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)<br>
        It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)<br>
        Merry Christmas Saint Nick<br>
        Christmas comes this time each year, ooh<br>
        Merry Christmas Saint Nick<br>
        Christmas comes this time each year, ooh<br>
