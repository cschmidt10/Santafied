        <p>Fay and Danny are madly in love and it's all Fay's ever dreamed of. But she left everything - including the
          delightful cake shop she used to run - to be with Danny on his cosy canal boat The Dreamcatcher. And as she

          Then Fay gets a call that sends her back to where it all began; back to where she first met Danny, back to her
          friends and the Cake Shop in the Garden. Even as Fay happily returns to dry land and her passion for baking,
          she knows it will be hard being away from Danny, especially with Christmas round the corner. But their
          relationship is strong enough to survive . . . isn't it?</p>
